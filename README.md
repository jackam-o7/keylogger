# Python Keylogger
## Description
This project is focused on creating a keylogger in Kali Linux to capture and log keystrokes. Understanding how keyloggers function is essential for cybersecurity, enabling better protection against these types of attacks. My keylogger will be implemented using Python, taking advantage of Kali Linux's environment to simplify the process and avoid paltform-specific complications. The primary aim of this project is to gain hands-on experience with keyloggers, learning how they operate in real-world attacks. The knowledge gained will improve detection techniques and overall system security in professional environments.
